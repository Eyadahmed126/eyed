        A sports car is a car designed with an emphasis on dynamic performance, such as handling, acceleration, top speed, the thrill of driving, and racing capability. Sports cars originated in Europe in early 1902 and are currently produced by many manufacturers around the world.    </b></p>

   <span ><h2>Common elements</h2></span>
  <p></p> Definitions of sports cars often relate to how the car design is optimised for dynamic performance,[3][4] without any specific minimum requirements; both a Triumph Spitfire and Ferrari 488 Pista can be considered sports cars, despite vastly different levels of performance. Broader definitions of sports cars include cars "in which performance takes precedence over carrying capacity",[5] or that emphasise the "thrill of driving"[6] or are marketed "using the excitement of speed and the glamour of the (race)track"[7] However, other people have more specific definitions, such as "must be a two-seater or a 2+2 seater"[8] or a car with two seats only</b></p><p><b>Common rules among the sports include:
</b></p><b>
<ul><li>Toyota <i>GR86</i> Over a decade ago in 2012, Toyota ended its sports car hiatus with the launch of the GT86.</li>
<li>A clearly defined area in which to play the game.</li>
<li><i>Scoring</i> <i>goals</i> or <i>points</i> by moving the ball to an opposing team's end of the field and either into a goal area, or over a line.</li>
<li>Goals or points resulting from players putting the Cars between two <i>goalposts</i>.</li>
<li>The goal or line being <i>defended</i> by the opposing team.</li>
<li>BMW M2. The BMW M2 is an absolute triumph. ...
</li></ul></b>
<p><b>In all codes, common skills includepassing, tackling, evasion of tackles, catching and kicking. In most codes, there are rules restricting the movement of players <i>offside</i>, and players scoring a goal must put the ball either under or over a <i>crossbar</i> between the goalposts.
